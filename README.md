This was written to download videos specifically from vimeo and youtube only. 

To build, pull down main.py and main.spec into the same directory, then within that directory, create a folder called yt-dlp and one called ffmpeg, instructions below on installing them.
Once yt-dlp.exe and ffmpeg.exe have been put into the corresponding folders, run "pyinstaller main.spec". This will build main.exe in the dist folder, which can then be moved into the main directory, and ran 

yt-dlp.exe and ffmpeg.exe will need to be put into the corresponding folders
